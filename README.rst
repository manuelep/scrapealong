Scrape-A-Long
========================

Just include this library as a sub-module in your py4web applications.

## Configure

Just add a *settings_private.py* file in each path:

  * `tripadvisor -> hotels`
  * `tripadvisor -> restaurant`
  * `tripadvisor -> turism`

with the values of location *uri* you want to be monitored (follow the example in
parallel *settings.py* files).
